"""
Personal Quiz App
------------------
A fun general-knowledge and "about you" quiz for young coders!

How it works:
1. We ask the player's name.
2. We ask 5 fun questions (a mix of general knowledge and "about you" questions).
3. We keep a running score using a variable.
4. At the end, we give a friendly message based on how many they got right.

This uses only what's taught in Lessons 1-7: variables, input(), f-strings,
int() conversion, and if/elif/else.
